Hi there! 
🚀 About Me
🎓 I am Osman Ulubas, a Software Developer and a DevOps Engineer. I am also Pursuing my MBA and will graduate in early-2023.

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and have contributed to several Gigantic Organizations including, Material UI, Microsoft, Amazon, Webhint, and countless others. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2021, I learned Next.js, Progressive Web App (PWA), GraphQL, Micro-Frontend Architecture and Blockchain development & DApps. I got started with Freelancing and Blogging quite recently and made a name for myself.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from skiing, sports, comics.

📚 I also love reading comic books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy in the genre of personal development and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy.

✈️ I love traveling too. I have been on solo trips to Niagra Falls in 2015 and to Key West in 2016.
